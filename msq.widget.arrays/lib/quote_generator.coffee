Then think of doing it twenty-four hours a day.","author":"Markus Zusak"},{"text":"If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Warriors should suffer their pain silently.","author":"Erin Hunter"},{"text":"It is the power of the mind to be unconquerable.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"Complaining does not work as a strategy. We all have finite time and energy. Any time we spend whining is unlikely to help us achieve our goals. And it won't make us happier.","author":"Randy Pausch"},{"text":"Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We've been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.","author":"Lucius Annaeus Seneca"},{"text":"Life is such unutterable hell, solely because it is sometimes beautiful. If we could only be miserable all the time, if there could be no such things as love or beauty or faith or hope, if I could be absolutely certain that my love would never be returned: how much more simple life would be. One could plod through the Siberian salt mines of existence without being bothered about happiness. Unfortunately the happiness is there. There is always the chance (about eight hundred and fifty to one) that another heart will come to mine. I can't help hoping, and keeping faith, and loving beauty. Quite frequently I am not so miserable as it would be wise to be.","author":"T.H. White"},{"text":"People hide their truest nature. I understood that; I even applauded it. What sort of world would it be if people bled all over the sidewalks, if they wept under trees, smacked whomever they despised, kissed strangers, revealed themselves?","author":"Alice Hoffman"},{"text":"A Stoic is someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking.","author":"Taleb Nassim Nicholas"},{"text":"Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it easier to maintain control.","author":"Epictetus"},{"text":"Feeling too much is a hell of a lot better than feeling nothing.","author":"Nora Roberts"},{"text":"How do you defeat terrorism? Don’t be terrorized.","author":"Salman Rushdie"},{"text":"Why should we place Christ at the top and summit of the human race? Was he kinder, more forgiving, more self-sacrificing than  ? Was he wiser, did he meet death with more perfect calmness, than  ? Was he more patient, more charitable, than  ? Was he a greater philosopher, a deeper thinker, than  ? In what respect was he the superior of  ? Was he gentler than  , more universal than  ? Were his ideas of human rights and duties superior to those of  ? Did he express grander truths than  ? Was his mind subtler than  ’s? Was his brain equal to  ’s or  ’s? Was he grander in death – a sublimer martyr than  ? Was he in intelligence, in the force and beauty of expression, in breadth and scope of thought, in wealth of illustration, in aptness of comparison, in knowledge of the human brain and heart, of all passions, hopes and fears, the equal of  , the greatest of the human race?","author":"Robert G. Ingersoll"},{"text":"For what prevents us from saying that the happy life is to have a mind that is free, lofty, fearless and steadfast - a mind that is placed beyond the reach of fear, beyond the reach of desire, that counts virtue the only good, baseness the only evil, and all else but a worthless mass of things, which come and go without increasing or diminishing the highest good, and neither subtract any part from the happy life nor add any part to it? A man thus grounded must, whether he wills or not, necessarily be attended by constant cheerfulness and a joy that is deep and issues from deep within, since he finds delight in his own resources, and desires no joys greater than his inner joys.","author":"Lucius Annaeus Seneca"},{"text":"What do you know of my heart? What do you know of anything but your own suffering. For weeks, Marianne, I've had this pressing on me without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature. It was forced on me by the very person whose prior claims ruined all my hope. I have endured her exultations again and again whilst knowing myself to be divided from Edward forever. Believe me, Marianne, had I not been bound to silence I could have provided proof enough of a broken heart, even for you.","author":"Jane Austen"},{"text":"Always resignation and acceptance. Always prudence and honour and duty. Elinor, where is your heart?","author":"Jane Austen"},{"text":"The things you think about determine the quality of your mind.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Misfortune nobly born is good fortune.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Regard [a friend] as loyal, and you will make him loyal.","author":"Lucius Annaeus Seneca"},{"text":"Limiting one’s desires actually helps to cure one of fear. ‘Cease to hope … and you will cease to fear.’ … Widely different [as fear and hope] are, the two of them march in unison like a prisoner and the escort he is handcuffed to. Fear keeps pace with hope … both belong to a mind in suspense, to a mind in a state of anxiety through looking into the future. Both are mainly due to projecting our thoughts far ahead of us instead of adapting ourselves to the present.","author":"Lucius Annaeus Seneca"},{"text":"You should … live in such a way that there is nothing which you could not as easily tell your enemy as keep to yourself.","author":"Lucius Annaeus Seneca"},{"text":"Nothing is burdensome if taken lightly, and nothing need arouse one's irritation so long as one doesn't make it bigger than it is by getting irritated.","author":"Lucius Annaeus Seneca"},{"text":"You know yourself what you are worth in your own eyes; and at what price you will sell yourself. For men sell themselves at various prices. This is why, when Florus was deliberating whether he should appear at Nero's shows, taking part in the performance himself, Agrippinus replied, 'Appear by all means.' And when Florus inquired, 'But why do not you appear?' he answered, 'Because I do not even consider the question.' For the man who has once stooped to consider such questions, and to reckon up the value of external things, is not far from forgetting what manner of man he is.","author":"Epictetus"},{"text":"What really frightens and dismays us is not external events themselves, but the way in which we think about them. It is not things that disturb us, but our interpretation of their significance.","author":"Epictetus"},{"text":"There will never come a time when I will be able to resist my emotions.","author":"Louise Erdrich"},{"text":"Think of your many years of procrastination; how the gods have repeatedly granted you further periods of grace, of which you have taken no advantage. It is time now to realise the nature of the universe to which you belong, and of that controlling Power whose offspring you are; and to understand that your time has a limit set to it. Use it, then, to advance your enlightenment; or it will be gone, and never in your power again.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"I hear my silence talked of in every lane; The suppression of a cry is itself a cry of pain.","author":"Darshan Singh"},{"text":"If you want to make progress, put up with being perceived as ignorant or naive in worldly matters, don't aspire to a reputation for sagacity. If you do impress others as somebody, don't altogether believe it. You have to realize, it isn't easy to keep your will in agreement with nature, as well as externals. Caring about the one inevitably means you are going to shortchange the other.","author":"Epictetus"},{"text":"Remember to act always as if you were at a symposium. When the food or drink comes around, reach out and take some politely; if it passes you by don't try pulling it back. And if it has not reached you yet, don't let your desire run ahead of you, be patient until your turn comes. Adopt a similar attitude with regard to children, wife, wealth and status, and in time, you will be entitled to dine with the gods. Go further and decline these goods even when they are on offer and you will have a share in the gods' power as well as their company. That is how Diogenes, Heraclitus and philosophers like them came to be called, and considered, divine.","author":"Epictetus"},{"text":"Hunger is by far the best spice.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Show by a cheerful look that you don't need the help or comfort of others. Standing up - not propped up.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"People seek retreats for themselves in the countryside by the seashore, in the hills, and you too have made it your habit to long for that above all else. But this is altogether unphilosophical, when it is possible for you to retreat into yourself whenever you please; for nowhere can one retreat into greater peace or freedom from care than within one’s own soul, especially when a person has such things within him that he merely has to look at them to recover from that moment perfect ease of mind (and by ease of mind I mean nothing other than having one’s mind in good order). So constantly grant yourself this retreat and so renew yourself; but keep within you concise and basic precepts that will be enough, at first encounter, to cleanse you from all distress and to send you back without discontent to the life to which you will return.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"We all die having lived a full life, even those who die while they are being born.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Anxiety is the shadow of what we do not want to lose.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"The triviality of a question does not make a profound answer an impossibility.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Being spiritually asleep has deceived the vast majority of people into thinking that poverty is a poor person’s main problem in life. To those who are spiritually awake, poverty is not even a problem.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"You can wear an expensive watch and still be late.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"A family member is initially loved out of expectation … and is eventually loved out of habit.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Life is the struggle of delaying death.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Happiness is sweet; its pursuit, bitter.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"We cannot be too young to die.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"You cannot really not care about what others think about you, yet care about whether or not they know that you do not care about what they think about you.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Some fools have children. Some have children who have children. And some have children who have children who have children.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Unless you are spiritually awakened, being happy requires you to ignore or forget other people’s suffering.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much… The life we receive is not short but we make it so","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"Show by a cheerful look that you don't need the help or comfort of others. Standing up - not propped up.","author":"Marcus Aruelius"},{"text":"Be like a headland: the Waves beat against it continuously, but it stands fast and around it the boiling water dies down.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Stoicism is a mild form of pessimism … sprinkled with optimism.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"One of the main goals and effects of stoicism is to stop an adult from being a crybaby.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"We all too often invite a lie by asking someone how he or she is doing.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"No one is too old to live another day, or too young to die today.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Only those who are stupid mind coming across as stupid.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"There is no correlation between how many people or things, how much money, or how many problems you have … and how grateful, happy, or peaceful you can be.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Pleasure and pain are often each other’s seed.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"To make life very pleasurable, expect nothing. To make it even more pleasurable than that, expect nothing … but the worst.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Sometimes we want not freedom of choice, but freedom from choice.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"A millionaire who is a minimalist feels and is a trillion times richer than billionaires who are not minimalists.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Complaining about a person is way less annoying when we complain to that person.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"We gain the highest degree of freedom when we lose the desire to live, and gain the second highest degree when we lose the desire to live as long as we possibly can.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Concern should drive us into action and not into a depression. No man is free who cannot control himself.","author":"Pythagoras"},{"text":"Our education system would be betraying its master, capitalism, if it taught us to be content with what we have. Or if it told us about the fruits of practicing minimalism.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"To complain about life is to complain about being alive.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"If you care about yourself at all, come to your own aid while there’s still time.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Some solutions are seeds of some problems.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"You can be too old to live, but not too young to die.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Marcus wept when he was told that his favorite tutor had passed away. We know that he cried one day in court, when he was overseeing a case and the attorney mentioned the countless souls who perished in the plague still ravaging Rome. We can imagine Marcus cried many other times. This was a man who was betrayed by one of his most trusted generals. This was a man who one day lost his wife of thirty-five years. This was a man who lost eight children, including all but one of his sons. Marcus didn’t weep because he was weak. He didn’t weep because he was un-Stoic. He cried because he was human. Because these very painful experiences made him sad. “Neither philosophy nor empire,” Antoninus said sympathetically as he let his son sob, “takes away natural feeling.” So Marcus Aurelius must have lost his temper on occasion, or he never would have had cause to write in his Meditations.","author":"Ryan Holiday"},{"text":"No parent should outlive their children. To lose eight of them? So young? It staggers the mind. “Unfair” does not even come close. It’s grotesque. How easily this could shatter a person, how easily and understandably it might cause them to toss away everything they ever believed, to hate a world that could be so cruel. Yet somehow we have Marcus Aurelius","author":"Ryan Holiday"},{"text":"We do not need to lose people or things to appreciate them.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Hating our opponent benefits us. Underestimating them benefits them.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"We each unwittingly contribute, each and every day, to the preventions and to the causes of millions of accidents.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"We do things for others for ourselves.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"We are good to others only because we think that that is, or will be, good for us.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"We must say nothing, when we have nothing to say.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"The best kind of pleasure comes from the indifference to pain … and pleasure.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"A wise answer is even more pleasing when it is a response to a foolish question.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Sometimes the only thing you can do is accept the fact that there is nothing you can do.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"It is foolish to expect a fool to act wisely.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Not everything that could have been done should have been done.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"What is happening is life’s way of telling us what should be happening.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Gluttony is nothing other than lack of self-control with respect to food, and human beings prefer food that is pleasant to food that is nutritious.","author":"Musonius Rufus"},{"text":"You cannot love what you have become, yet hate what you have overcome.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Learning how to live would take most people at least three lifetimes.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Our efforts do not owe us our desired outcomes.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Funerals greatly exaggerate the pleasantness of being alive, while they prevent us from thinking about the advantages of being dead.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Freedom of speech does not come with opinions worth listening to.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"It is joyful to see someone who is hopeful in a situation that is hopeless.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Some real kings are drama queens.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"We would rarely waste time if our existence were earned.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"Saving money, when buying an unnecessary thing, leads to wasting time, when using the thing.","author":"Mokokoma Mokhonoana"},{"text":"For those who follow nature everything is easy and straightforward, whereas for those who fight against her life is just like rowing against the stream.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"We should not use philosophy like a herbal remedy, to be discarded when we're through. Rather, we must allow philosophy to remain with us, continually guarding our judgements throughout life, forming part of our daily regimen, like eating a nutritious diet or taking phisical exercise.","author":"Musonius Rufus"},{"text":"So the spirit must be trained to a realization and an acceptance of its lot. It must come to see that there is nothing fortune will shrink from[.]  There's no ground for resentment in all this. We've entered into a world in which these are the terms life is lived on – if you're satisfied with that, submit to them, if you're not, get out, whatever way you please.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"What good does it do you to go overseas, to move from city to city? If you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you're needing is not to be in a different place but to be a different person.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"[E]verything which went beyond our actual needs was just so much unnecessary weight, a burden to the man who had to carry it.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"In order to protect ourselves we must live like doctors and be continually treating ourselves with reason.","author":"Musonius Rufus"},{"text":"Ambition: The willingness to continually question and assess one’s acceptance and contentment with their place in life; conjunct with the willingness to take action should a resolvable discrepancy between one’s values and one’s current standing, present itself. By extension, an ambitious person is someone who has to the best of their abilities thoughtfully defined their values and continues on to do whatever is reasonably possible to fully embrace who they are in life.","author":"Yann Tanguay"},{"text":"[W]e can have the things we need for our ordinary purposes if we will only be content with what the earth has made available on its surface.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"The things that are essential are acquired with little bother; it is the luxuries that call for toil and effort.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"[W]hatever happens is never as serious as rumour makes it out to be.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"[T]he man who spends his time choosing one resort after another in a hunt for peace and quiet, will in every place he visits find something to prevent him from relaxing. The story is told that someone complained to Socrates that travelling abroad had never done him any good and received the reply: \"What else can you expect, seeing that you always take yourself along with you when you go abroad?‟","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"To lose someone you love is something you'll regard as the hardest of all blows to bear, while all the time this will be as silly as crying because the leaves fall from the beautiful trees that add to the charm of your home. [...] At one moment chance will carry off one of them, at another moment another; but the falling of the leaves is not difficult  to bear, since they grow again, and it is no more hard to bear the loss of those whom you love and regard as brightening your existence; for even if they do not grow again they are replaced. \"But their successors will never be quite the same.\" No, and neither will you.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"Many are the things that have caused terror during the night and been turned into matters of laughter with the coming of daylight.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"[A] man is wealthy if he has attuned himself to his restricted means and has made himself rich on little.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"People prone to every fault they denounce are walking advertisements of the uselessness of their training. That kind of man can be of no more help to me as an instructor than a steersman who is seasick in a storm[...]. What good to me is a vomiting and stupefied helmsman? [...] What is needed is a steering hand, not talking.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"Let me indicate here how men can prove that their words are their own: let them put their preaching into practice","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"All vices are at odds with nature.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"Zeno is our friend but truth is an even greater friend.","author":"Latin saying without author."},{"text":"Life is divided into three periods, past, present and future. Of these, the present is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain. For this last is the one over which Fortune has lost her power, which cannot be brought back to anyone’s control. But this is what preoccupied people lose: for they have no time to look back at their past, and even if they did, it is not pleasant to recall activities they are ashamed of.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"Consider what intemperate lovers undergo for the sake of evil desires, and how much exertion others expend for the sake of making profit, and how much suffering those who are pursuing fame endure, and bear in mind that all of these people submit to all kinds of toil and hardship voluntarily. Is it then not monstrous that they for no honorable reward endure such things, while we for the sake of the ideal good - that is not only the avoidance of evil such as wrecks our lives, but also the acquisition of virtue, which we may call the provider of all goods -- are not ready to bear every hardship? And yet would not anyone admit how much better it is, in place of exerting oneself to win someone else's wife, to exert oneself the discipline of one's desires; in place of enduring hardships for the sake of money, the train oneself to want little; instead of giving oneself trouble about getting notoriety; instead of trying to find a way to injure an envied person, to enquire how not to envy anyone; and instead of slaving, as sycophants do, to win false friends, to undergo suffering in order to possess true friends? Since toil and hardship are a necessity for all, both for those who seek better and worse, it is preposterous that those pursuing the better are not much more eager in their efforts than those for whom there is small hope of reward for all their pains. ... It remains for me to say that who is unwilling to exert himself almost always convicts himself as unworthy of good, since all good is gained by toil.","author":"Musonius Rufus"},{"text":"Resent a thing by all means if it represents an injustice decreed against yourself personally; but if this same constraint is binding on the lowest and the highest alike, then make your peace again with destiny, the destiny that unravels all ties.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"More active and commendable still is the person who is waiting for the daylight and intercepts the first rays of the sun; shame on him who lies in bed dozing when the sun is high in the sky, whose waking hours commence in the middle of the day.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"[T]he man who lives extravagantly wants his manner of living to be on everybody's lips as long as he is alive. He thinks he is wasting his time if he is not being talked about.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"If you admit to having derived great pleasures, your duty is not to complain about what has been taken away but to be thankful for what you have been given.","author":"Seneca"},{"text":"Один из главных принципов стоицизма состоит в умении различать вещи, которыми мы можем управлять и которыми — нет.","author":"Massimo Pigliucci"},{"text":"Но в действительности стоицизм — это не подавление или сокрытие эмоций, а их осознание, размышление об их причинах и умение направлять их себе на благо. Это понимание того, что находится под нашим контролем, а что — нет: следует сосредоточить усилия на первом, вместо того чтобы напрасно тратить их на второе.","author":"Massimo Pigliucci"},{"text":"Стоик стремится к добродетели, совершенству и живет по принципу: «Делать все настолько хорошо, насколько это возможно», он осознает моральный аспект всех своих действий.","author":"Massimo Pigliucci"},{"text":"Здоровье, образование и богатство считаются «предпочтительными безразличными вещами», стоики не пропагандировали аскетизм, многие из них не чурались жизненных благ и умели наслаждаться ими. Однако эти вещи не определяют нас как уникальных индивидуумов и не имеют ничего общего с нашей личностной ценностью, а она зависит исключительно от нашего характера и наших добродетелей.","author":"Massimo Pigliucci"},{"text":"Но в этом-то и состоит сила стоицизма: признание фундаментальной истины, что мы можем контролировать только свое поведение, но не его результаты (не говоря уже о результатах поведения других людей), дает нам способность невозмутимо принимать происходящее. Это происходит, потому что мы знаем: сделано все возможное и все зависящее от нас в данных обстоятельствах.","author":"Massimo Pigliucci"},{"text":"Но Эпиктет призывал мужественно смотреть в лицо реальности, а реальность такова, что все люди смертны и никто из них не принадлежит нам и не останется с нами навечно. [...] Признав эту реальность, мы понимаем, что должны наслаждаться любовью наших близких и общением с ними, когда это возможно, а не принимать их как должное: ведь неминуемо настанет день, когда «установленное время года» пройдет.","author":"Massimo Pigliucci"},{"text":"When you pursue wisdom, you will soon realize how much you don’t know. Your knowledge will be incomplete, but continually developing through your curiosity.  Arrogance blocks new information from coming in. When you’re conceited, you’ll resist change, and struggle to preserve your fixed image. Don’t fall into smug idleness, used to comfort. Challenge what you think you know, not caring if other people see you as a fool.

They seek for themselves private retiring places, as country villages, the sea-shore, mountains; yea thou thyself art wont to long much after such places. But all this thou must know proceeds from simplicity in the highest degree. At what time soever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free from all businesses. A man cannot any whither retire better than to his own soul; he especially who is beforehand provided of such things within, which whensoever he doth withdraw himself to look in, may presently afford unto him perfect ease and tranquillity. By tranquillity I understand a decent orderly disposition and carriage, free from all confusion and tumultuousness. Afford then thyself this retiring continually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself. Let these precepts be brief and fundamental, which as soon as thou dost call them to mind, may suffice thee to purge thy soul throughly, and to send thee away well pleased with those things whatsoever they be, which now again after this short withdrawing of thy soul into herself thou dost return unto. For what is it that thou art offended at? Can it be at the wickedness of men, when thou dost call to mind this conclusion, that all reasonable creatures are made one for another? and that it is part of justice to bear with them? and that it is against their wills that they offend? and how many already, who once likewise prosecuted their enmities, suspected, hated, and fiercely contended, are now long ago stretched out, and reduced unto ashes? It is time for thee to make an end. As for those things which among the common chances of the world happen unto thee as thy particular lot and portion, canst thou be displeased with any of them, when thou dost call that our ordinary dilemma to mind, either a providence, or Democritus his atoms; and with it, whatsoever we brought to prove that the whole world is as it were one city? And as for thy body, what canst thou fear, if thou dost consider that thy mind and understanding, when once it hath recollected itself, and knows its own power, hath in this life and breath (whether it run smoothly and gently, or whether harshly and rudely), no interest at all, but is altogether indifferent: and whatsoever else thou hast heard and assented unto concerning either pain or pleasure? But the care of thine honour and reputation will perchance distract thee? How can that be, if thou dost look back, and consider both how quickly all things that are, are forgotten, and what an immense chaos of eternity was before, and will follow after all things: and the vanity of praise, and the inconstancy and variableness of human judgments and opinions, and the narrowness of the place, wherein it is limited and circumscribed? For the whole earth is but as one point; and of it, this inhabited part of it, is but a very little part; and of this part, how many in number, and what manner of men are they, that will commend thee? What remains then, but that thou often put in practice this kind of retiring of thyself, to this little part of thyself; and above all things, keep thyself from distraction, and intend not anything vehemently, but be free and consider all things, as a man whose proper object is Virtue, as a man whose true nature is to be kind and sociable, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. Among other things, which to consider, and look into thou must use to withdraw thyself, let those two be among the most obvious and at hand. One, that the things or objects themselves reach not unto the soul, but stand without still and quiet, and that it is from the opinion only which is within, that all the tumult and all the trouble doth proceed. The next, that all these things, which now thou seest, shall within a very little while be changed, and be no more: and ever call to mind, how many changes and alterations in the world thou thyself hast already been an eyewitness of in thy time.

So when you call someone “untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on yourself. It was you who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did you expect from helping someone out?

You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. Nowhere you can go is more peaceful—more free of interruptions—than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony. So keep getting away from it all—like that. Renew yourself. But keep it brief and basic. A quick visit should be enough to ward off all  . . .  and send you back ready to face what awaits you. What’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior? But take into consideration: • that rational beings exist for one another; • that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience; • that no one does the wrong thing deliberately; • and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried. . . . and keep your mouth shut. Or are you complaining about the things the world assigns you? But consider the two options: Providence or atoms. And all the arguments for seeing the world as a city. Or is it your body? Keep in mind that when the mind detaches itself and realizes its own nature, it no longer has anything to do with ordinary life—the rough and the smooth, either one. And remember all you’ve been taught—and accepted—about pain and pleasure. Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us—how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space—and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are. So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self. Above all, no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look at things like a man, like a human being, like a citizen, like a mortal. And among the things you turn to, these two: i. That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within—from our own perceptions. ii. That everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you’ve already seen. “The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"no matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, \"no matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Your mind will take on the character of your most frequent thoughts: souls are dyed by thoughts.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Perfection of character: to live your last day, every day, without frenzy, or sloth, or pretense.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"fame in a world like this is worthless.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Everything is interwoven, and the web is holy; none of its parts are unconnected.

Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest. For with what art thou discontented? With the badness of men? Recall to thy mind this conclusion, that rational animals exist for one another, and that to endure is a part of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily; and consider how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting, have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet at last.- But perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee out of the universe.- Recall to thy recollection this alternative; either there is providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of things; or remember the arguments by which it has been proved that the world is a kind of political community, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps corporeal things will still fasten upon thee.- Consider then further that the mind mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its own power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented to about pain and pleasure, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps the desire of the thing called fame will torment thee.- See how soon everything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side of the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness and want of judgement in those who pretend to give praise, and the narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet at last. For the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it is this thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people are they who will praise thee.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"What we cannot bear removes us from life; what remains can be borne.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"All men are made one for another: either then teach them better or bear with them.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Life is opinion.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"The blazing fire makes flames and brightness out of everything thrown into it.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Unhappy am I because this has happened to me.- Not so, but happy am I, though this has happened to me, because I continue free from pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Think of your many years of procrastination; how the gods have repeatedly granted you further periods of grace, of which you have taken no advantage.

Be sure you are neglecting other work if you busy yourself with what such a one is doing and why, with what he is saying, thinking, or scheming. All such things do but divert you from the steadfast guardianship of your own soul. It behoves you, then, in every train of thought to shun all that is aimless or useless, and, above all, everything officious or malignant. Accustom yourself so, and only so, to think, that, if any one were suddenly to ask you, Of what are you thinking-now? you could answer frankly and at once, Of so and so. Then it will plainly appear that you are all simplicity and kindliness, as befits a social being who takes little thought for enjoyment or any phantom pleasure; who spurns contentiousness, envy, or suspicion; or any passion the harbouring of which one would blush to own. For such a man, who has finally determined to be henceforth among the best, is, as it were, a priest and minister of the Gods, using the spirit within him, which preserves a man unspotted from pleasure, unwounded by any pain, inaccessible to all insult, innocent of all evil; a champion in the noblest of all contests—the contest for victory over every passion. He is penetrated with justice; he welcomes with all his heart whatever befalls, or is appointed by Providence. He troubles not often, or ever without pressing public need, to consider what another may say, or do, or design. Solely intent upon his own conduct, ever mindful of his own concurrent part in the destiny of the Universe, he orders his conduct well, persuaded that his part is good. For the lot appointed to every man is part of the law of all things as well as a law for him. He forgets not that all rational beings are akin, and that the love of all mankind is part of the nature of man; also that we must not think as all men think, but only as those who live a life accordant with nature. As for those who live otherwise, he remembers always how they act at home and abroad, by night and by day, and how and with whom they are found in company. And so he cannot esteem the praise of such, for they enjoy not their own approbation.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"27. How cruel—to forbid people to want what they think is good for them.

Like growth and maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the first gray hair. Like sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical changes at each stage of life, our dissolution is no different. So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to us. Now you anticipate the child’s emergence from its mother’s womb; that’s how you should await the hour when your soul will emerge from its compartment. Or perhaps you need some tidy aphorism to tuck away in the back of your mind. Well, consider two things that should reconcile you to death: the nature of the things you’ll leave behind you, and the kind of people you’ll no longer be mixed up with. There’s no need to feel resentment toward them—in fact, you should look out for their well-being, and be gentle with them—but keep in mind that everything you believe is meaningless to those you leave behind. Because that’s all that could restrain us (if anything could)—the only thing that could make us want to stay here: the chance to live with those who share our vision. But now?

As they do so they produce a phantasia, a mental impression. From this the mind generates a perception (hypolepsis), which might best be compared to a print made from a photographic negative. Ideally this print will be an accurate and faithful representation of the original. But it may not be. It may be blurred, or it may include shadow images that distort or obscure the original. Chief among these are inappropriate value judgments: the designation as “good” or “evil” of things that in fact are neither good nor evil. For example, my impression that my house has just burned down is simply that—an impression or report conveyed to me by my senses about an event in the outside world. By contrast, my perception that my house has burned down and I have thereby suffered a terrible tragedy includes not only an impression, but also an interpretation imposed upon that initial impression by my powers of hypolepsis. It is by no means the only possible interpretation, and I am not obliged to accept it. I may be a good deal better off if I decline to do so. It is, in other words, not objects and events but the interpretations we place on them that are the problem.

Human beings, for Marcus as for the Stoics generally, are social animals, a point he makes often (e.g., 5.16, 8.59, 9.1). All human beings possess not only a share of the logos but also the ability to use it (that is what makes us human and distinguishes us from other animals). But it would perhaps be more accurate to say that we are participants in the logos, which is as much a process as a substance. Marcus himself more than once compares the world ruled by logos to a city in which all human beings are citizens, with all the duties inherent in citizenship. As human beings we are part of nature, and our duty is to accommodate ourselves to its demands and requirements—“to live as nature requires,” as Marcus often puts it. To do this we must make proper use of the logos we have been allotted, and perform as best we can the functions assigned us in the master plan of the larger, cosmic logos, of which it is a part. This requires not merely passive acquiescence in what happens, but active cooperation with the world, with fate and, above all, with other human beings.

In our relationships with others we must work for their collective good, while treating them justly and fairly as individuals.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Don’t look at things the way wrong-doers do.

Instead, strive to see things in truth, as they really are.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"To the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly everything good.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do it with. And that I was never put in that position myself—of having to take something from someone else.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Altogether the interval is small between birth and death; and consider with how much trouble, and in company with what sort of people and in what a feeble body this interval is laboriously passed. Do not then consider life a thing of any value. For look to the immensity of time behind thee, and to the time which is before thee, another boundless space. In this infinity then what is the difference between him who lives three days and him who lives three generations?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Whatever this is that I am, it is flesh and a little spirit and an intelligence. Throw away your books; stop letting yourself be distracted. That is not allowed. Instead, as if you were dying right now, despise your flesh. A mess of blood, pieces of bone, a woven tangle of nerves, veins, arteries. Consider what the spirit is: air, and never the same air, but vomited out and gulped in again every instant. Finally, the intelligence. Think of it this way: You are an old man. Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"The third discipline, the discipline of will, is in a sense the counterpart to the second, the discipline of action. The latter governs our approach to the things in our control, those that we do; the discipline of will governs our attitude to things that are not within our control, those that we have done to us (by others or by nature). We control our own actions and are responsible for them. If we act wrongly, then we have done serious harm to ourselves (though not, it should be emphasized, to others, or to the logos). By contrast, things outside our control have no ability to harm us. Acts of wrongdoing by a human agent (torture, theft, or other crimes) harm the agent, not the victim. Acts of nature such as fire, illness, or death can harm us only if we choose to see them as harmful. When we do so, we question the benevolence and providence of the logos, and thereby degrade our own logos. This, of course, we must not do. Instead we must see things for what they are (here the discipline of perception is relevant) and accept them, by exercising the discipline of will, or what Epictetus calls (in a phrase quoted by Marcus) “the art of acquiescence.” For if we recognize that all events have been foreseen by the logos and form part of its plan, and that the plan in question is unfailingly good (as it must be), then it follows that we must accept whatever fate has in store for us, however unpleasant it may appear, trusting that, in Alexander Pope’s phrase, “whatever is, is right.” This applies to all obstacles and (apparent) misfortunes, and in particular to death—a process that we cannot prevent, which therefore does not harm us, and which accordingly we must accept willingly as natural and proper.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Anywhere you can lead your life, you can lead a good one.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"to how much envy and fraud and hypocrisy the state of a tyrannous king is subject unto, and how they who are commonly called [Eupatridas Gk.], i.e. nobly born, are in some sort incapable, or void of natural affection.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"that that life which any the longest liver, or the shortest liver parts with, is for length and duration the very same, for that only which is present, is that, which either of them can lose, as being that only which they have; for that which he hath not, no man can truly be said to lose.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"If it is not right, do not do it: if it is not true, do not say it.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Disgraceful if, in this life where your body does not fail, your soul should fail you first.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"لامجد لك بمعزل عن مجد قومك . مالا يفيد السرب لايفيد النحلة . لامجد لنحلة في خلية منهارة","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"My soul, will you ever be good, simple, individual, bare, brighter than the body covers you? Will you ever taste the disposition to love and affection? Will you ever be complete and free of need, missing nothing, desiring nothing live or lifeless for the enjoyment of pleasure?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"The best kind of revenge is, not to become like unto them.' There","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Every soul, the philosopher says, is involuntarily deprived of truth; consequently in the same way it is deprived of justice and temperance and benevolence and everything of the kind. It is most necessary to bear this constantly in mind, for thus thou wilt be more gentle towards all.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Keep before your eyes the swift onset of oblivion, and the abysses of eternity before us and behind; mark how hollow are the echoes of applause, how fickle and undiscerning the judgments of professed admirers, and how puny the arena of human fame. For the entire earth is but a point, and the place of our own habitation but a minute corner in it; and how many are therein who will praise you, and what sort of men are they?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Stick to what's in front of you - idea, action, utterance.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"No random actions, none not based on underlying principles.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"It is circumstances (difficulties) which show what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. For what purpose? you may say. Why, that you may become an Olympic conqueror; but it is not accomplished without sweat. In my opinion no man has had a more profitable difficulty than you have had, if you choose to make use of it as an athlete would deal with a young antagonist.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"I walk in Nature's way until I shall lie down and rest, breathing my last in this from which I draw my daily breath, and lying down on this from which my father drew his vital seed, my mother her blood, my nurse her milk; from which for so many years I am fed and watered day by day; which bears my footstep and my misusing it for so many purposes.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Remember how long thou hast already put off these things, and how often a certain day and hour as it were, having been set unto thee by the gods, thou hast neglected it.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Remember this, that very little is needed to make a happy life.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"a ripe mature man, a perfect sound man; one that could not endure to be flattered; able to govern both himself and others.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Let not the future trouble you; for you will come to it, if come you must, bearing with you the same reason which you are using now to meet the present.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"It is high time for thee, to understand that there is somewhat in thee, better and more divine than either thy passions, or thy sensual appetites and affections","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Is any man so foolish as to fear change, to which all things that once were not owe their being? And what is it, that is more pleasing and more familiar to the nature of the universe?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"36. Man, thou hast been a citizen in this great state [the world]: what difference does it make to thee whether for five years [or three]? for that which is conformable to the laws is just for all. Where is the hardship then, if no tyrant nor yet an unjust judge sends thee away from the state, but nature who brought thee into it? the same as if a praetor who has employed an actor dismisses him from the stage. “But I have not finished the five acts, but only three of them.”—Thou sayest well, but in life the three acts are the whole drama; for what shall be a complete drama is determined by him who was once the cause of its composition, and now of its dissolution: but thou art the cause of neither. Depart then satisfied, for he also who releases thee is satisfied","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"The ruler must be a philosopher as well as a king; and he must govern unwillingly, because he loves philosophy better than dominion.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them together: your own existence and the things that happen to you.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Does another do me wrong? Let him look to it. He has his own disposition, his own activity. I now have what the universal nature wills me to have; and I do what my nature now wills me to do.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Studying philosophy instills modesty and straightforwardness in your character.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"ناور العقبات ، واتخذ منها وقوداً لفضيلتك ، واسع إلى مقاصدك بتحفظ يخفف عنك صدمة الاخفاق","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Často sa dopúšťa bezprávia aj ten, kto nič nerobí, nielen ten, kto niečo robí.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"My mind. What is it? What am I making of it? What am I using it for? Is it empty of thought? Isolated and torn loose from those around it? Melted into flesh and blended with it, so that it shares its urges?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"I have no right to do myself an injury. Have I ever injured anyone else if I could avoid it?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"They contemn one another, and yet they seek to please one another: and whilest they seek to surpass one another in worldly pomp and greatness, they most debase and prostitute themselves in their better part one to another.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"If it doesn't harm your character, how can it harm your life?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Not to be offended with other men's liberty of speech, and to apply myself unto philosophy. Him","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"But by all means bear this in mind, that within a very short time both thou and he will be dead; and soon not even your names will be left behind.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"I am happy, though this has happened to me, because I continue free from pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"thereby gain much leisure, and save much trouble, and therefore at every action a man must privately by way of admonition suggest unto himself, What? may not this that now I go about,","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"For indeed whatsoever proceeds from the gods, deserves respect for their worth and excellency; and whatsoever proceeds from men, as they are our kinsmen, should by us be entertained, with love, always; sometimes, as proceeding from their ignorance, of that which is truly good and bad, (a blindness no less, than that by which we are not able to discern between white and black:) with a kind of pity and compassion also.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Najlepší spôsob obrany je nepodobať sa tým, čo nám ubližujú.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"A man must not only consider how daily his life wasteth and decreaseth, but this also, that if he live long, he cannot be certain, whether his understanding shall continue so able and sufficient, for either discreet consideration, in matter of businesses; or for contemplation: it being the thing, whereon true knowledge of things both divine and human, doth depend.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"That it’s not what they do that bothers us: that’s a problem for their minds, not ours. It’s our own misperceptions. Discard them. Be willing to give up thinking of this as a catastrophe . . . and your anger is gone. How do you do that? By recognizing that you’ve suffered no disgrace. Unless disgrace is the only thing that can hurt you, you’re doomed to commit innumerable offenses—to become a thief, or heaven only knows what else.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Give yourself a gift: the present moment. People out for posthumous fame forget that the Generations To Come will be the same annoying people they know now. And just as mortal. What does it matter to you if they say x about you, or think y?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, seashores, and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere, either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble, does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquillity; and I affirm that tranquillity is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"But he that honours a reasonable soul in general, as it is reasonable and naturally sociable, doth little regard anything else: and above all things is careful to preserve his own, in the continual habit and exercise both of reason and sociableness: and thereby doth co-operate with him, of whose nature he doth also participate; God.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"with how little he was satisfied, such as lodging, bed, dress, food, servants;","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"to be grave without affectation: to observe carefully the several dispositions of my friends, not to be offended with idiots, nor unseasonably to set upon those that are carried with the vulgar opinions, with the theorems, and tenets of philosophers: his conversation being an example how a man might accommodate himself to all men and companies; so that though his company were sweeter and more pleasing than any flatterer's cogging and fawning; yet was it at the same time most respected and reverenced:","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"If therefore it be a thing external that causes thy grief, know, that it is not that properly that doth cause it, but thine own conceit and opinion concerning the thing: which thou mayest rid thyself of, when thou wilt.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"You have embarked, made the voyage, and come to shore; get out. If indeed to another life, there is no want of gods, not even there. But if to a state without sensation, you will cease to be held by pains and pleasures, and to be a slave to the vessel, which is as much inferior as that which serves it is superior: for the one is intelligence and deity; the other is earth and corruption.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"An unphilosophical but nonetheless effective help to putting death in its place is to run over the list of those who have clung long to life. What did they gain over the untimely dead? In truth, the distance we have to travel is small: and we drag it out with such labor, in such poor company, in such a feeble body. No great thing, then. Look behind you at the huge gulf of time, and another infinity ahead. In this perspective what is the difference between an infant of three days and a Nestor of three generations?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"No hay que censurar a los dioses porque no yerran en nada, ni contra su voluntad ni a propósito. Tampoco a los hombres, porque en nada yerran si no es contra su voluntad. En conclusión no hay que censurar a nadie.","author":"Marco  Aurelio"},{"text":"Disturbance comes only from within- from our own perceptions. Everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"If thou art pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs thee, but thy own judgement about it. And it is in thy power to wipe out this judgement now. But if anything in thy own disposition gives thee pain, who hinders thee from correcting thy opinion? And even if thou art pained because thou art not doing some particular thing which seems to thee to be right, why dost thou not rather act than complain?","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"general, and a scarcity of individual healers. It was the doctrine of Marcus Aurelius that most of the ills of life come to us from our own imagination, that it was not in the power of others seriously to interfere with the calm, temperate life of an individual, and that when a fellow being did anything to us that seemed unjust he was acting in ignorance, and that instead of stirring up anger within us it should stir our pity for him. Oftentimes by careful self-examination we should find that the fault was more our own than that of our fellow, and our sufferings were rather from our own opinions than from anything","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"For what is just and good is on my side.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"And here thou must remember, that thy carriage in every business must be according to the worth and due proportion of it, for so shalt thou not easily be tired out and vexed, if thou shalt not dwell upon small matters longer than is fitting.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"It is a shame for the soul to be first to give way in this life, when thy body does not give way.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"For the entire earth is but a point, and the place of your own habitation but a minute corner in it. (...) Remember then to withdraw into the little field of self. Above all, never struggle or strain; but be master of yourself.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Today, I freed myself from trouble. Or rather, I wiped it out—for my trouble was caused by my opinion of things, so I changed the story I was telling myself.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"Whatever happens, happens rightly. Watch closely, and you will find this true. In the succession of events there is not mere sequence alone, but an order that is just right, as from the hand of one who dispense to their due.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"If you were asked to spell the name Antoninus, would you rap out each letter at the top of voice, and then, if your hearers grew angry, grow angry yourself in turn? Rather, would you not proceed to enumerate the several letters quietly one by one? Well then; remember that here in life every piece of duty is likewise made up of its separate items. Pay careful attention to each of these, without fuss and without returning temper for temper, and so ensure the methodical completion of your task.","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"How free from all vanity he carried himself in matter of honour and dignity, (as they are esteemed:) his laboriousness and assiduity, his readiness to hear any man, that had aught to say tending to any common good:","author":"Marcus Aurelius"},{"text":"How free from all vanity he carried himself in matter of honour and dignity, (as they are esteemed:) his laboriousness and assiduity, his readiness to hear any man, that had aught to say tending to any common good: how generally and impartially he would give every man his due; his skill and knowledge,","author":"Marcus Aurelius"}
